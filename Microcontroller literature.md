# Microcontroller literature

Note

The amount of documentation for all ARM chips is daunting for newcomers. The documentation for older microcontrollers such as the 6800, Z80 or 6502 easily fit in single large document, but as chips have evolved so has the documentation grown. The total documentation is especially hard to grasp for ARM based chips since it consists of documents from the IC manufacturer and documents from CPU core vendor (ARM Holdings). A typical top-down documentation tree is:

- manufacturer website, manufacturer marketing slides so you know what to buy.
- manufacturer electrical datasheet for the exact physical chip.
- manufacturer detailed reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.
- ARM core generic user guide.
- ARM core technical reference manual.
- ARM architecture reference manual that describes the instruction set(s).
